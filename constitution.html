                                    Objects. The object of the European Set Theory Society is to strengthen set-theoretical research and scholarship in Europe. Its primary function is to promote the exchange and sharing of ideas and results, to foster cooperation between dierent research groups through the mobility of students and researchers, to achieve a better awareness and appreciation of set theory, and to facilitate access to funding instruments and other resources. Although its activities are centred in Europe and the Associated States, the Society is open to set theorists worldwide, and its actions are carried out in cooperation with researchers in countries outside Europe and with bordering areas of research. The Society aims to create a dynamic research and training network in order to ensure a leading position for European set theory and bring this subject to a higher level. The Society shall have the following powers:

                      <p>The mission of the European Set Theory Society is to strengthen set-theoretical research and scholarship in Europe.
                      Although its activities are centred in Europe, the Society is open to set theorists worldwide.

                      <p>Set theory is the study of the mathematical infinite. It was born in the late 19th century with Georg Cantor’s
                        mathematical theory of transfinite numbers, and after its axiomatization by Zermelo and others in the early
                        20th century it developed into a general theory of infinite sets with numerous connections and applications in areas
                        such as algebra, topology, real and complex analysis, functional analysis, measure theory, and theoretical computer science.
                      </p>
                      <br>

                      <p>  In the last years, set theory has witnessed a renaissance with the creation of several new research groups
                        and a substantial increase in the number of researchers.
