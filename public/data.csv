We discuss the relevant concepts and tools that go into a core model induction through L(R) (or more generally through models of the form Lp^\Sigma(R)). We provide examples (PFA, the existence of an \omega_1-dense ideal on \omega_1 etc) that illustrate how these concepts are used in practice.";"Please contact Ernest Schimmerling in advance for the zoom link.

In particular, I will explain how the (unfortunately named) CSP Dichotomy Theorem implies a formal connection between computational and projective complexity and how this tells us exactly which graph homomorphism problems admit descriptive set theoretic dichotomies.";"See the seminar webpage."

In August 2021 I gave two talks in the CUNY set theory Zoominar of Vika Gitman which were largely devoted to expounding the last and hardest of my constructions in this area. The present talk will be devoted to my earlier and more basic results, some recent work, and various open problems which I hope might attract logicians working in areas such as the descriptive set theory of group actions.";"Please see the seminar webpage."

He used what came to be known as Jensen’s forcing to show that, consistently, there can be a Π12-definable non-constructible real. The ‘uniqueness of generic reals’ property of Jensen’s forcing extends to products of Jensen’s forcing and to finite iterations, when forcing over L. Indeed, a Jensen-like forcing with the same uniqueness properties can be constructed in any universe with a ♢-sequence. In a joint work with Friedman and Kanovei, we used a tree iteration of Jensen’s forcing to construct (in a symmetric submodel of the forcing extension) a model of full second-order arithmetic Z2 with the choice scheme in which the dependent choice scheme failed for a Π12-assertion (this is optimal because Z2 with the choice scheme implies dependent choice for Σ12-assertions). In this talk, I will present a generalization of Jensen’s forcing to forcing with perfect κ-trees for an inaccessible cardinal κ. I will show that Jensen’s forcing at an inaccessible has the same ‘uniqueness of generics’ properties as Jensen’s forcing. One of the goals of this work is to prove an analogue of the second-order arithmetic result for second-order set theory by showing that the dependent choice scheme is independent of the second-order Kelley-Morse set theory with the choice scheme. This is joint work with Sy-David Friedman.";"The seminar will take place virtually. Please email Victoria Gitman (vgitman@nylogic.org) for the meeting id."

"7";"CUNY Logic Workshop";"09/27/2022 15:20";"Friday, 30 September, 2:00 – 3:30 New York time (20:00-21:30 CEST)";"Hans Schoutens, CUNY";"The model-theory of categories";"One could make the claim that category theory is as foundational as set-theory or model-theory. So, we should be able to transfer from one perspective to the other. In this talk, I will consider one aspect of this meta-equivalence, by introducing a theory in a very simple, one-sorted(!) language, whose models are all categories admitting a terminal object (many categories do). Many categorical constructions then turn out to be first-order. But something even more strange happens: standard categories (like the category of Abelian groups) become actually universal models! I’ll explain this apparent contradiction. 
In the second part of the talk, I will concentrate on one particularly interesting category: that of compact Hausdorff spaces. I will show that we can recover the natural numbers N and the reals R, or rather, (the isomorphism classes of) their compactifications ¯N and ¯R, by parameter-free definitions, including their order relation, addition and multiplication. Moreover, in any category that is elementary equivalent to the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, the resulting objects are then a model of PA and a real closed field respectively. Full disclosure: while I have a complete proof for the first assertion, the second is still conjectural.
Apart from some basic model-theory, category theory and topology, everything else will be explained in the talk and so it should be accessible to many.";"The talk will take place in hybrid mode. Please see the seminar webpage or email Victoria Gitman for the link."
